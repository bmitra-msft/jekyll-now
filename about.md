I am an Applied Scientist at <a href="http://www.bing.com">Bing</a> in <a href="http://rmc-stage/en-us/labs/cambridge/">Microsoft Cambridge</a>. My research is focused on Web search, information retrieval and machine learning. I started at Bing in 2007 (then called Live Search) at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc/ApplicationServices/bing.aspx">Search Technology Center in India</a>. Since then I have worked on a number of problems related to document ranking, query formulation and recommendation, query re-writing, entity ranking and evaluation.

I am currently pursuing a (part-time) doctorate at <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a> under the supervision of Dr. <a href="http://mediafutures.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/emineyilmaz/">Emine Yilmaz</a> and Dr. <a href="http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber">David Barber</a>. My research interests include representation learning and neural networks, and in particular their application to modern day information retrieval.
