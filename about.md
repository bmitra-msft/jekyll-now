I am an Applied Scientist at [Bing](http://www.bing.com) in [Microsoft Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). My research is focused on Web search, information retrieval and machine learning. I started at Bing in 2007 (then called Live Search) at the [Search Technology Center in India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/msidc). Since then I have worked on a number of problems related to document ranking, query formulation and recommendation, query re-writing, entity ranking and evaluation.

I am currently pursuing a (part-time) doctorate at [University College London](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) under the supervision of Dr. [Emine Yilmaz](http://mediafutures.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/emineyilmaz/) and Dr. [David Barber](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber). My research interests include representation learning and neural networks, and in particular their application to modern day information retrieval.
