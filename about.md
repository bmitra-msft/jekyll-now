I am an Applied Scientist at <a href="http://www.bing.com">Bing</a> in Microsoft Research Cambridge. My research is focused on Web search, information retrieval and machine learning. I started at Bing in 2007 (then called Live Search) at the Search Technology Center in India. Since then I have worked on a number of problems related to document ranking, query formulation and recommendation, query re-writing, entity ranking and evaluation.

I am currently pursuing a (part-time) doctorate at University College London under the supervision of Dr. Emine Yilmaz and Dr. David Barber. My research interests include representation learning and neural networks, and in particular their application to modern day information retrieval.
